# JuliaSymbolics - Home

[JuliaSymbolics](https://github.com/JuliaSymbolics/) is the Julia organization dedicated to
building a fully-featured and high performance Computer Algebra System (CAS) for the Julia
programming language. It is currently home to a layered architecture of packages:

- Layer 3: [**Symbolics.jl**](https://github.com/JuliaSymbolics/Symbolics.jl) -- A fast symbolic system designed for everyday symbolic computing needs. It features:
    - Symbolic arithmetic with type information and multiple dispatch
    - Symbolic polynomials and trigonometric functions
    - Expression simplification
    - Differentiation
    - Symbolic linear algebra (factorizations, inversion, determinants, eigencomputations, etc.)
    - Discrete math (representations of summations, products, binomial coefficients, etc.)
    - Logical and Boolean expressions
    - Symbolic equation solving and conversion to arbitrary precision
    - Support for non-standard algebras (non-commutative symbols and customizable rulesets)
    - Special functions (list provided by [SpecialFunctions.jl](https://github.com/JuliaMath/SpecialFunctions.jl))
    - Automatic conversion of Julia code to symbolic code
    - Generation of (high performance and parallel) functions from symbolic expressions
    - Fast automated sparsity detection and generation of sparse Jacobian and Hessians

- Layer 2: [**SymbolicUtils.jl**](https://github.com/JuliaSymbolics/SymbolicUtils.jl) -- The low-level representation and expression rewriting system:
    - Stores common expressions in a fast canonical form that is simplified by default
    - Rule-based simplification for further simplification
    - Polynomial-normalization (i.e. use polynomial algebra to expand expressions)

- Layer 1: [**Metatheory.jl**](https://github.com/JuliaSymbolics/Metatheory.jl) -- General purpose algebraic metaprogramming and symbolic computation library.
    - A powerful expression rewriting system and first-class pattern matching engine, based on the pattern matcher in the [SICM book](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262028967/structure-and-interpretation-of-classical-mechanics/).
    - An eDSL (domain specific language) to define different kinds of symbolic rewrite rules.
    - A flexible library of rewriter combinators.
    - E-graph rewriting (equality saturation) system and pattern matcher, inspired from the [egg library](https://egraphs-good.github.io/)
    - Backtracking and non-deterministic term rewriting using e-graphs.
    - Features available as generic as possible: rewrite on Julia native `Expr`, Symbolics.jl expressions or any expression satisfying [TermInterface.jl](https://github.com/JuliaSymbolics/TermInterface.jl).

- Layer 0: [**TermInterface.jl**](https://github.com/JuliaSymbolics/TermInterface.jl) -- Shared generic interface for symbolic expressions.
    - Definition of general functions for fast primitive manipulation of symbolic expressions.
    - Define methods for your expression types for the functions in this interface to use [Metatheory.jl](https://github.com/JuliaSymbolics/Metatheory.jl) features on any expression type.
